# SUMOMCP - SUMO Model Context Protocol Integration

##### Call for Proposals for Fetures üö®‚ùóÔ∏è: Kindly create an issue with your proposal to have discussion/implementation.

## Overview
SUMOMCP is a Python package that provides an interface for integrating SUMO with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows users to interact with SUMO's simulation environment and manage model contexts using MCP. The package is designed to facilitate the development of autonomous driving applications by providing a seamless connection between SUMO and MCP.

## Features
- [x] Integration with SUMO simulation environment
- [x] Support for Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- [x] Easy-to-use API for managing model contexts
- [ ] Support for various SUMO sensors and actors
- [ ] Ability to run simulations and collect data

## Installation
To install SUMOMCP, you can use uv. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

```bash
uv run main.py
```

#### Alert ‚ö†Ô∏è: This project is at initial stage and want contributors to help in development.
